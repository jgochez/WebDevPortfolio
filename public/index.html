                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>The HTML file <strong>"index.html"</strong>--sometimes "default.html"--is the conventional
                    homepage used for web servers. This file is called the <strong>designated homepage</strong>
                    which is the directory where the web server will take you when the <strong>"/" </strong>
                    request is made. This convention can transcend page format where, in addition to 
                    index.html, you will see other languages use the same convention such as <strong>index.js</strong>
                    and <strong>index.php</strong> used as well.
                </p>
                <p>When comparing the content in the <strong>Web Dev/Inspector Network</strong> tab between the local
                    and web server noticeable differences are found. You will first notice that after
                    clicking on the "index.html" file, the server has a substantial amount of information
                    under the <strong>Request</strong> and <strong>Respond Header</strong> that the local file does 
                    not have such as <strong>age</strong>, <strong>connection</strong>, <strong>content-decoding</strong>
                    <strong>content-length</strong>, etc. Most notably, you will see that the server has a <strong>favicon.ico</strong>
                    file with the OSU icon displaying on the tab.
                </p>
                <p>When one inspects the files in the Web Dev/Inspector Network tab, you will see that
                    the HTML response code is <strong>200</strong>, as expected, as that code lets us know the file request
                    was successfully retrieved. However, the same cannot be said for the CSS and JS files.
                    Despite the source files being referenced in the head-section above, the files do not 
                    exist, thus, the <strong>404</strong> code is returned which means that our URL attempted to
                    search for the files, but nothing was found.
                </p>
                <p>The following is a component breakdown of this file's <strong>URL</strong>: https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~gochezjo/a2-gochezjo.
                    Our <strong>scheme</strong>, which identifies the protocol used to send the request, is: "https". The <strong>subdomain</strong>, 
                    which is an additional directory appended by the host name, to help narrow down the search, is : "web.engr." The <strong>host name</strong>,
                    which is the name of the host/server name of the machine which carries the desired content which we are attempting
                    to connect to, is: "oregonstate.edu". Finally, our <strong>resource path</strong>, which is the path through the directory and folders
                    that gets us to the desired file, is "~gochezjo/a2-gochezjo". In addition, while our URL does not include the <strong>root file</strong>,
                    it is implied: "index.html".

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>The concept of <strong>frontend design </strong> focuses around the user's experience in using any 
                    given program, application, webpage, etc. One of the pivotal features of frontend design is the visual and interactive 
                    design of a page, also known as the <strong>graphical user-interface (GUI)</strong>. These designs can include icons or images decorated 
                    with fonts and colors that help the user assimilate themselves to the page and quickly grasp its functionalities, and 
                    of course, enjoy the experience. Frontend design can be further broken down into what engineers have called the <strong>
                    five “E”'s of Usability</strong>.
                    
                </p>
                <h4>Five “E” s of Usability</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Effective</strong></dt>
                    <dd>- an effective page is one where the overall design yields the correct functionality that leads one 
                        to receive the correct information, destination, and overall expectation.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Efficiency</strong></dt>
                    <dd>- an efficient page isn't just one that works, but it's one which is designed to help the user get to their
                        desired goal in the least amount of steps and quickest time possible.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Ease of Navigation</strong></dt>
                    <dd>- arguably one of the most important features is the ability to design a page with the most user-friendly 
                        interface. This page's accessibility would make even a newcomer's first experience in navigating the path's 
                        of the page to their destination as seamless as possible and easy to repeat.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Error-free</strong></dt>
                    <dd>- an error-free page is one where the designer has figured out common logical and technical roadblocks and issues 
                        that users may run into, and designed the page to help the user avoid them. Edge cases can be real thorns on 
                        the developer's side, that could be the cause of bad feedback.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Enjoyable</strong></dt>
                    <dd>- finally, whether a developer is dealing with a competitive market or with a community that requires certain services,
                        the final touch to any page and arguably the factor that will make users come back is how much they enjoyed the experience.
                        This includes the effectiveness of the previous <em>four</em> “E” s and any additional visual and interactive designs that
                        makes the experience memorable and even desirable.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <h4>Purpose of Page Layout Tags</h4>

                <h5>&lt;Header&gt;</h5>
                <p>The header tag represents the page banner that introduces the page and its most basic biographical information, such as the 
                    name, purpose, and slogan, etc. The convention is to keep this as small as possible and appear throughout every internal 
                    page.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;nav&gt;</h5>
                <p>Short for navigation, this tag takes us from the current page to the page link attached to this tag. It is common for 
                    these tags to take us to the page's main menu, contacts, etc.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;main&gt;</h5>
                <p>This tag will be the block that holds the primary information and content of the page. Because of this vital role it 
                    is a distinct tag to the section tag below.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;section&gt;</h5>
                <p>The content of a page may be extensive, so a way to organize the content thematically is through the section tag. Typically
                    we will have each section started off with a headline &lt;h1&gt; describing the section. 
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;article&gt;</h5>
                <p>When the &lt;section&gt; tag has been deployed and more content related to this specific section exists, it is good practice
                    to organize this content with article tags within the section. Just as the section tag, the article tag should be started off
                    with a headline, however, of lower grade: &lt;h2&gt;. If multiple articles exist, it's a great heuristic to have these tags
                    labeled with an ID selector (<em>#topic</em>) to allow a nav tab to link to that particular article.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;aside&gt;</h5>
                <p>Used as a supplement to an article, the aside tag will typically float on the sides with a distinct style but relatable
                    content.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;figure&gt;</h5>
                <p>Similar to the aside tag, the figure tag will supplement an article with some related media, whether an image, gif, etc. This
                    supplemental media will be tagged with &lt;img&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; tags, with the name of the tags describing their
                    purpose all within the figure tag.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;blockquote&gt;</h5>
                <p>While text is usually displayed with a &lt;p&gt; such as the tags that are currently displaying this paragraph we are reading,
                    when the text is extensive, it is recommended to use the block quote tag. It is also visually different to emphasize its distinct
                    length, which comes typically with a purpose in mind from the standpoint of the page. This tag will include two other tags:
                    quote &lt;q&gt; and citation &lt;cite&gt;, which go within the block quote tag.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;footer&gt;</h5>
                <p>Typically the last bit of content one sees at the very end of the page. The conventional purpose is to display the copyright, year of
                    publication and owner's name. We will also see legal and contact information with links to relevant and important pages. One will need 
                    to use ASCII entities to display particular symbols not found in a traditional keyboard.
                </p>

                <h5>&lt;div&gt;</h5>
                <p>The div tag is primarily used as a placeholder, whether for stand-alone information or for visual spacing of content. It has no style
                    or dimension, it is truly just a placeholder when no other appropriate tag exists.
                </p>
                <h4>How <strong>anchors</strong> link to:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>External Content</strong>: one must use the external content's URL within the anchor tag &lt;a&gt;. We must also include 
                        a description of the URL within the anchor tag which will be displayed with blue font to the user to point out it is a link. The following
                        is an example of how this looks in HTML (<strong>note:</strong> words in bold are the only things the user needs to modify): 
                        <em>&lt;a href="<strong>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/</strong>"&gt; 
                        <strong>MDN's Developer Website</strong>&lt;/a&gt;</em>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Internal Content</strong>: the tag where the desired content is at--where we plan to navigate to--must be given an ID. The 
                        user then uses an anchor tag identically to that appearing above in external content, where the only difference lies in
                        replacing the URL with a "#" followed directly by the ID found in the desired tag. Here is an example of the both the tag where the ID 
                        and thus location is created followed by the anchor tag that takes us there (<strong>note:</strong> words in bold are the only 
                        things the user needs to modify):
                        <em>&lt;article id="<strong>topic</strong>"&gt;<strong>The content for this topic...</strong>&lt;/article&gt;</em>
                        <em>&lt;a href="#<strong>topic</strong>" &gt;<strong>Topic</strong>&lt;/a&gt;</em>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Page-to-Page</strong>: the most common way to navigate from page-to-page is to create <strong>relative paths</strong> by creating
                        <strong>relative URLs</strong> which work by creating a path to a page relative to the current page. This URL will be inserted in the nav tag between 
                        the quotes: href="<strong>here</strong>".  <strong>The following three paths can be created:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Same directory</strong>: The simplest way of navigating between pages is if the navigation occurs between the same directory. 
                                To do this, we reference the page we are looking for and use that name as the relative URL. For example, if we have two files within
                                the same directory--contacts.html and index.html--and we are attempting to create a path from contacts.html to index.html, we simply 
                                write: <em><strong>index.html</strong></em>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Down the child directory</strong>: If we are in a directory and are attempting to access a page that is within a folder
                                that is in the same directory as we are, the path we create is by accessing the desired folder in the directory and finally accessing
                                the page within that folder. Our relative URL will begin with the folder's name, followed by "/" (which signifies
                                the user <em>accessing</em> the folder), and finally the name of the page inside the folder. So if we are attempting to access page 
                                "index.html" that is inside folder “product”, a folder that is in the same directory as our current page, the URL would look like this:
                                 <em><strong>product/index.html</strong></em>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Up the parent directory</strong>: If we are trying to navigate to a page that requires us to <em>exit</em> our folder into a 
                                parent directory to then <em>enter</em> a different folder to finally access our desired page, we must use the ".." symbol (which signifies <em>
                                exiting</em> a folder, in contrast with "/" which signifies <em>entering</em>). Furthermore, if we have a directory with two folders: homepage
                                and contacts--and we are inside the homepage folder in page index.html, and we are trying to navigate to contacts.html--which is found
                                inside the contacts folder--we would write the following URL: <em><strong>../contacts/contacts.html</strong></em>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Optimizing images</h3>
                <p>
                    There are six major specifications of images for the web. The first is a <strong>descriptive file name</strong>, whose importance is primarily 
                    based on the <em>search engine optimization (SEO)</em>. When one searches on the web for a file, bots will look for keywords to narrow down the 
                    search for the user. The more descriptive an image is, the higher the chance to find the image, and the more traffic your image gets. Because of
                    this reality, this specification is on the top of the list of important specifications. The second major specification is a <strong>small file size</strong>.
                    This specification should be quite self-explanatory. Smaller file sizes equals faster load time. There are also ways to <em>compress</em> the file
                    using two methods with the goal of smaller file sizes: <em>lossless</em> compression, which protects the quality of the image, but at the cost of a larger compressed image. 
                    <em>Lossy</em> compression will create a much smaller compressed file, but at the cost of its quality. The third specification is the <strong>
                    exact dimensions</strong>. This specification emphasizes the need to fit images in blocks that have a fixed size. Cropping and size reduction can 
                    modify the dimensions of an image to fit in this block. Fourth, the <strong>correct file format</strong>, which may appear trivial, is quite important
                    because each format will dictate how information in an image is stored and encoded with respect to its corresponding platform. For example, if 
                    you are dealing with two-dimensional, interactive images, you would use the <em>Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)</em> format, since SVG uses
                    mathematically-derived methods with XML to format the image. If you are using line-art, a format that handles 8-bit transparency and/or animations
                    would be used. Because <em>GIF</em> is a file format with a very limited number of colors and a low file size meant to handle simplistic imagery, 
                    this file format is ideal for line-art. In addition to GIF, <em>PNG</em> carries the advantage of lossless compression which is typically recommended 
                    for simple images such as line-art due to its ability to retain quality. PNG also supports transparency, which saves more space when dealing with images 
                    with a lot of empty space such as line-art.
                    On a different token, a format that can adequately handle photography will need a powerful compression ability to handle
                    the amount of detail that it would most likely carry and finally be able to leave the final cut in a rectangular shape. The file formats that would
                    be able to handle this task are <em>JPG</em> and <em>WebP</em>. The fifth specification is <strong>reduced resolution</strong>. Because most monitors are built 
                    to handle a specific range of resolution, to maximize the quality of an image it would be necessary to modify (typically reduce) the resolution to fit 
                    within the abilities of the monitor for image quality. Finally, the <strong>color mode</strong> is important because--well, aside from the fact that life would never 
                    be the same without color--each file format is compatible with a specific mode. Traditionally we have three types of modes: RGB, Hexadecimal, and HSL. However,
                    when dealing with .PNG, .JPG, .SVG, and .WebP, we use RBG for its great balance of moderate file size and image quality.

                <p>
                    Favicons are images that are placed on the browser tab with the purpose of providing visual information corresponding to the content found in the given file.
                    To use a favicon, one must create an image (simplicity recommended) which is then formatted into different file formats, typically .SVG and .PNG. Favicon
                    generators may often take your image sample and modify to a more optimal layout. Furthermore, because different devices may handle image quality at different 
                    success rates, different file formats are kept in the directory and picked up by the browser for selection based on optimal quality. Once the file formats have
                    been created, you create link tags in the HTML code that connects to these files and the browser will do the magic.
