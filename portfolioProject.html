            <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>The HTML file <strong>"index.html"</strong>--sometimes "default.html"--is the conventional
                    homepage used for web servers. This file is called the <strong>designated homepage</strong>
                    which is the directory where the web server will take you when the <strong>"/" </strong>
                    request is made. This convention can transcend page format where, in addition to 
                    index.html, you will see other languages use the same covention such as <strong>index.js</strong>
                    and <strong>index.php</strong> used as well.
                </p>
                <p>When comparing the content in the <strong>Web Dev/Inspector Network</strong> tab between the local
                    and web server noticeable differences are found. You will first notice that after
                    clicking on the "index.html" file, the server has a substantial amount of information
                    under the <strong>Request</strong> and <strong>Respond Header</strong> that the local file does 
                    not have such as <strong>age</strong>, <strong>connection</strong>, <strong>content-decoding</strong>
                    <strong>content-length</strong>, etc. Most notably, you will see that the server has a <strong>favicon.ico</strong>
                    file with the OSU icon displaying on the tab.
                </p>
                <p>When one inspects the files in the Web Dev/Inspector Network tab, you will see that
                    the HTML response code is <strong>200</strong>, as expected, as that code lets us know the file request
                    was successfully retrieved. However, the same cannot be said for the CSS and JS files.
                    Despite the source files being referenced in the head-section above, the files do not 
                    exist, thus, the <strong>404</strong> code is returned which means that our URL attempted to
                    search for the files, but nothing was found.
                </p>
                <p>The following is a component breakdown of this file's <strong>URL</strong>: https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~gochezjo/a2-gochezjo.
                    Our <strong>scheme</strong>, which identifies the protocol used to send the request, is: "https". The <strong>subdomain</strong>, 
                    which is an additional directory appended by the host name, to help narrow down the search, is : "web.engr." The <strong>host name</strong>,
                    which is the name of the host/server name of the machine which carries the desired content which we are attempting
                    to connect to, is: "oregonstate.edu". Finally, our <strong>resource path</strong>, which is the path through the directory and folders
                    that gets us to the desired file, is "~gochezjo/a2-gochezjo". In addition, while our URL does not include the <strong>root file</strong>,
                    it is implied: "index.html".

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>The concept of <strong>frontend design </strong>frontend design focuses around the user's experience in using any 
                    given program, application, webpage, etc. One of the pivotal features of frontend design is the visual and interactive 
                    design of a page, also known as the <strong>graphical user-interface (GUI)</strong>. These designs can include icons or images decorated 
                    with fonts and colors that helps the user assimilate themselves to the page and quickly grasps its functionalities, and 
                    of course, enjoy the experience.Frontend design can be further broken down into what engineers have called the <strong>
                    five "E"'s of Usability</strong>.
                    
                </p>
                <h4>Five "E"s of Usability</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Effective</dt>
                    <dd>- an effective page is one where the overall design yields the correct functionality that leads one 
                        to receive the correct information, destination, and overall expecation.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Efficiency</dt>
                    <dd>- an efficient page isn't just one that works, but it's one which is designed to help the user get to their
                        desired goal in the least amount of steps and quickest time possible.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Ease of Navigation</dt>
                    <dd>- arguably one of the most important features is the ability to design a page with the most user-friendly 
                        interface. This page's accessability would make even a newcomer's first experience in navigating the path's 
                        of the page to their destination as seemless as possible and easy to repeat.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Error-free</dt>
                    <dd>- an error-free page is one where the designer has figured out common logical and technical roadblocks and issues 
                        that user's may run into and designed the page to help the user avoic them. Edge cases can be real thorns on 
                        the developer's side that could be the cause of bad feedback.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Enjoyable</dt>
                    <dd>- finally, whether a developer is dealing with a competitive market or with a community that requires certain services,
                        the final touch to any page and arguably the factor that will make users come back is the enjoyability of the experience.
                        This includes the effectiveness of the previous <em>four</em> "E"s and any additional visual and interactive designs that
                        makes the experience memorable and even desirable.
