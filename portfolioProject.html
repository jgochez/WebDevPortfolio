    <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
    <p>The HTML file "index.html"--sometimes "default.html"--is the conventional
        homepage used for web servers. This file is called the designated homepage
        which is the directory where the web server will take you when the "/" request 
        is made. This convention can transcend page format where, in addition to 
        .html, you will see index.js and index.php used as well.

    </p>
    <p>When comparing the content in the Web Dev/Inspector Network tab between the local
        and web server noticable differences are found. You will first notice that after
        clicking on the "index.html" file, the server has a substantial amount of information
        under the Request and Respond Header that the local file does not have such as age, 
        connection, content-decoding, content-length, etc. Most notably, you will see that
        the server has a favicon.ico file with the OSU icon displaying on the title.
    </p>
    <p>When one inspects the files in the Web Dev/Inspector Network tab, you will see that
        the html response code is 200, as expected, as that code lets us know the file request
        was successfully retrieved. However, the same cannot be said for the css and js files.
        Despite the source file being referenced in the head-section above, the files do not 
        exist, thus, the 404 code is returned which means that our URL attempted to
        search for the files but nothing was found.
    </p>
    <p>The following is a component breakdown of this file's URL: https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~gochezjo/a1-gochezjo.
        Our scheme, which identifies the protocol used to send the request is: "https". The subdomain, which is an
        additional directory appended by the host name to help narrow down the search, is : "web.engr." The host name, 
        which is the name of the host/server name of the machine which carries the desired content which we are attempting
        to connect to, is: "oregonstate.edu". Finally our resource path, which is the path through the directory and folders
        that gets us to the desired file, is "~gochezjo/a1-gochezjo". In addition, while our URL does not include the root file,
        it is implied: "index.html".
